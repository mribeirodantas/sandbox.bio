##### Problem

An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing `A`, `C`, `G`, and `U`.

Given a DNA string _t_ corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string _u_ is formed by replacing all occurrences of `T` in _t_ with `U` in _u_.

**Given**: A DNA string _t_ having length at most 1000 nt.

**Return**: The transcribed RNA string of _t_.
